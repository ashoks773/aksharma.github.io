### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am working as a postdoctoral scientist in Casero and Devkota Lab at the Inflammatory Bowel and Immunobiology Research Institute at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. And the focus of my research is to identify probable mechanisms by which bacterial activities regulate immune responses in individuals having Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease. I implement bioinformatics pipelines and machine-learning-based computational methods to analyze and integrate multi-omics datasets. Before that, I worked as a postdoctoral associate at the University of Minnesota- Twin Cities. I was involved in the understanding of factors that impact gut microbial composition/function and its subsequent interactions with the host. Before starting my postdoctoral journey in the United States, I completed my bachelor's and master's in Pharmaceutical Sciences, followed by a Ph.D. in Computational Biology from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Bhopal, India. 
I will keep applying AI/machine learning and other data-driven approaches to understand diet-microbiome-host interactions in animals and humans under diverse physiological conditions. And would like to contribute to the areas of 1) Microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics and 2) Personalized food and medicine to improve animal and human health using my data analysis skills.
